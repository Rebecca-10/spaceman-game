My Spaceman Game

Description
Spaceman is a browser-based word guessing game inspired by Hangman.  
Players try to guess a secret word, one letter at a time, before running out of lives.  
The game was built to practice JavaScript, DOM manipulation, arrays, and event handling, and it demonstrates how to structure a small interactive browser based app 



Background
Hi! I'm Becca, a software engineer and a medical technician. 
I wanted to create a simple, fun game that showcases my understanding of JavaScript objects, arrays, DOM manipulation, and event-driven programming.  
This project also helped me practice UI/UX design with CSS Flexbox to make the game visually appealing and accessible.

How to Play
1. The game will randomly select a secret word from a small set of words.  
2. Your goal is to guess the word one letter at a time.  
3. Enter a letter in the input box and click Guess.  
4. Correct guesses reveal the letter in the word.  
5. Wrong guesses decrease your remaining lives.  
6. Win by guessing all letters before you run out of lives!  
7. The game displays all letters guessed and the number of lives left.
